#### Research: 
I have over two years of experience collecting and analyzing social media data. I am strongly focused on the use of social media by Hispanic politicians and have found that the content of their communication can be easily predicted using demographic factors. 

Among the many methods employed in my research, I can mention, qualitative and quantitative content analysis with statistical clustering, sentiment analysis and social network analysis.

Experience in survey analysis with hierarchical linear modeling and structural equation - multilevel modeling.

I have published scholarly research using social media data.

I have presented my findings in several research conferences at both the regional and national level.


#### Research Skills: 
Qualitative Research Methods, Survey Research Design, Structural Equation and Multilevel Modeling for Survey Design, Data Collection, Applied Regression, Random & Fixed Effects Modeling, Statistical Clustering, Social Network Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Content Analysis, Sentiment Analysis. 

#### Research Software:
I have experience with quantitative software such as: R, STATA, Orange, SPSS, NodeXL, Gephi, RATS, EViews, Lisrel, Python.

I also have experience with qualitative software such as: MaxQDA, WordStat, ATLAS.ti, QSR Nvivo, Power BI.
