I am a Full Time Lecturer at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (Go Vaqueros!!). I am a social and political scientist working at the intersection of the collection of social media data and US policy. I collect data and analyze it using a series of quantitative and qualitative content analysis methods which allow me to better understand what factors influence communication in social media. I focus on American institutions and policy with a concentration on Hispanics and the types of political issues most important to this crucial population.
