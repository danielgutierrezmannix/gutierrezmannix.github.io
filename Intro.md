I am a social and political scientist working at the intersection of the collection of social media data and US policy. I collect data and analyze it using a series of quantitative and qualitative content analysis methods which allow me to better understand what factors influence communication in social media. I focus on American institutions and policy with a concentration on Hispanics and the types of political issues most important to this crucial population. 


My main focus lies on understanding what factors lie behind communication by minorities. Specifically, I explore the reasons behind communication by diverse groups of minorities. My current research explores differences in communication among different segments of the Hispanic population. 

During my time as an International Student, I have worked in the positions of Tutor, Research Assistant, Teaching Assistant, Instructor and Part-Time Lecturer. 
Moreover, with the help of professors and peers, I have been able to maintain a diverse research and publishing agenda. 
Examples of this include: my research into language assimilation in the U.S.-Mexico border, my research into social media use by State politicians. 
My research, however, has also covered areas such as surveillance and security in Mexico and Organized Violence in Mexico.  
Lastly, I have presented my research in more than ten academic conferences.

Currently I am focused on working towards my doctoral dissertation in which I will make use of an Application Programming Interface (API) with Twitter to study and research political behavior by Hispanic politicians in The United States.
